Scheduler Application... 
This simple intuitive project allows for managers and employees to login using their info and interact with a couple menu options. 
Managers can auto assign shifts, view weekly schedule, view pings (requests, questions from employees). 
Employees can first of all create a new account with their preferred schedule availability as a team member; as a team lead, this is set to full time.
With the employee menu, one can view their personal weekly schedule, and send pings to manager. 
More capabilities will be added over time. 
Git pushing wasn't able to push the "lib" file. Hence manually sorted the executables and source files in terminal by running " javac -d bin src/*.java "
To run the program I used, " java -cp bin SchedulerApp "
Open to any better way if proposed. 
Thank you.
