<h1>Advanced Work Scheduler</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>This repository contains an advanced version of a Work Scheduler application, originally developed as a final project for an Object-Oriented Programming course. The project demonstrates the practical application of OOP concepts and showcases significant enhancements over the original version.</p>

<h2>Original Project</h2>

<p>The initial project was a collaborative effort with two classmates, resulting in a terminal-based Work Scheduler application. Key features included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User roles: Manager and Employee</li>
  <li>Manager functionalities:
    <ul>
      <li>Add/remove date times</li>
      <li>Create and view schedules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Employee functionalities:
    <ul>
      <li>View personal schedules</li>
      <li>Notify managers of schedule conflicts or time-off requests</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enhanced Version</h2>

<p>To challenge myself and create a more realistic application, I developed this enhanced version with the following improvements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User Account Creation</strong>: New employees can now create their own accounts, improving scalability and user management.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Implemented password masking during input, significantly improving security and user privacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Scheduling</strong>: Replaced manual schedule editing with an intelligent auto-assign feature:
    <ul>
      <li>Employees can input their availability</li>
      <li>Schedules are automatically generated based on employee availability</li>
      <li>Implemented a constraint to ensure no more than two team leads are scheduled simultaneously</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>: The application now more closely emulates real-life work scheduling systems, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>: Utilized classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a robust and maintainable codebase.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Structures</strong>: Implemented efficient data structures for managing employee information and schedules.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm Design</strong>: Developed a custom algorithm for auto-assigning schedules while respecting constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Incorporated comprehensive input validation to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics</h2>

<h3>Code Statistics:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lines of code: ~2,500</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>This project provided valuable insights and learning experiences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Deepened understanding of OOP principles and their practical applications</li>
  <li>Gained experience in refactoring and enhancing existing codebases</li>
  <li>Developed skills in algorithm design for real-world problems</li>
  <li>Improved understanding of user experience considerations in software development</li>
  <li>Enhanced ability to implement security features in applications</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability</li>
  <li>Integrate with external calendar systems</li>
  <li>Develop a mobile/ web application version</li>
</ul>
